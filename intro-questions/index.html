    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <h3>Brian Lee | Communication Design | Sophomore Class of 2025</h3>
    <p>1. I am pursuing the HCI minor as part of a desire to major in the Interaction Design pathway. I am fascinated by the ever evolving world of Experience Design and hope to pursue a career within this field.</p>
    <p>2. I took a web design class in middle school where we used HTML and CSS but it has been a while.</p>
    <p>3. Through this class, I hope to learn the fundamental building blocks of the web to better fundamentally understand the design process from a developer's point of view.</p>
    <p>4. I imagine designing for the web has far more hard limits and constraints to work around defined by what's possible technologically.</p>
    <p>5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> YouTube, despite the many complaints lobbed by its user-base, has — at least in my opinion — an effective design. Because the services provided by the site are mainly video based and not next and image based as with most other sites its UI is naturally unique and has been the gold standard other sites aspite to emulate. Its simple but powerful side bar allows for the creation of playlists while the tabs helpfully organize videos by either what's trending, your personal subscriptions, or YouTube's own recommendations.</p>
    <p>6. <a href="https://www.samsungsds.com/en/index.html">Samsung SDS</a> This site's only goal is to communicate what Samsung SDS is and the services they provide. Since they are a B to B company, they aren't selling anything and don't need a product system in place. The site has large images and videos with clear text that highlights the message the company wishes to convey to potential clients.</p>
    <p>7. <a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/"> Dominos</a>What this site lacks in aesthetics and organization, it makes up for in pure functionality and ease of use. User's visiting the site largely have one goal in mind: to order a pizza and the site makes it clear where to go to do that and what information it needs to get the pizza from the shop to your door.</p>
